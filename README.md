# Quantum Field Theory Lecture Notes - MIT OCW (Hong Liu)
These are my personal lecture notes based on the MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) Quantum Field Theory (QFT) course taught by Professor **Hong Liu**. The course is a comprehensive introduction to quantum field theory, a fundamental framework for understanding the quantum behavior of fields and particles, and is central to many areas of theoretical physics, including particle physics and condensed matter theory.

## Status of the Notes
I began compiling these notes on **6th October 2024** and will attempt to upload notes covering the entire course. However, I am not certain if I will upload all of the lecture notes, as this will depend on the progress of my own studies and understanding.
